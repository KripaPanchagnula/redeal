Deal's example 5:

When I first wrote this I was somewhat surprised.

This deals hands where south opens a strong blue club and north has a 3+
controls (that is, he has a strong positive response.)

I was surprised to find that slam was making 1/2 the time on these hands.  In
other words, for Blue-clubbers, if the auction starts:

    1C  1S/1NT/2C/2D

there is a 50% chance that a slam should be bid...
